# bubble-up-economics
Political/Economic Idea (Opposite of Trickle Down)

## Warren Buffet made a statement that if all Bilionares paid their taxes, there would be no need for laymen to pay taxes. Not even SS or Medicare. 
### If the layman doesn't have to pay taxes, he gets 20% of his paycheck back. He can use that 20% to pay for items he couldn't afford before, he could use it toward that mortgage, which frees up more room for frivalities, etc...
### All of these new affordable items are being bought from those corporations and business owners. Who then have more money to pay the laymen for his ocupation. 
#THE MONEY BUBBLES UP Because the people in lower income brackets now have more freedom to buy things, putting money in the pockets of business owners, putting money in the pockets of landlords, etc...
